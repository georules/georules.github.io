How it works:
MATERIALS are provided free by Udacity’s Intro to Computer Science course - a 7 unit course designed for 3 months @ 6 hours/week.

YOU watch online videos and complete online quizzes prior to class meetings.

CLASS meetings occur weekly for 2-4 hours.  Class will include reviewing materials, extra lectures, group activities, and completing problem sets.  Class size is limited to 10 students committed to the coursework.

GEO will lecture on current and related topics, personal mentorship & help, office hours by appointment.  I will get you through this course!
